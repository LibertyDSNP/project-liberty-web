        This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to personal information
        collected through www.projectliberty.io, and other products and
        services, including websites, mobile apps, registration forms, and other
        digital properties, as expressly indicated by Project Liberty such as
        through a link to or other display of this Privacy Policy (all of the
        foregoing collectively, this “Site”). By visiting and/or using this
        Site, you have agreed to this Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Project Liberty (“we” or “us”) reserves the right to change this Privacy
        Policy at any time by posting revisions to this Site. Such changes will
        be effective upon posting. Project Liberty includes Liberty 3.0 LLC and
        its subsidiaries.

        We are working very hard to modernize the experience of all users on the
        Internet to further empower the ability of you, the user, to make
        privacy decisions yourself through technology—and hopefully thereby
        making the need to write and read lengthy privacy policies like this one
        a thing of the past. We are counting on you to help us get there! But
        until then, here we go.

        <h1 className="body__h1">What personal information do we collect?</h1>
        <p>
          Cookies are for eating—not for tracking. We do not use tracking
          cookies, web beacons or third-party analytics on our site. We
          additionally do not use persistent ID cookies on this site except
          where you click “remember me” or are logged in; we may however use
          session cookies, which expire when you close your browser, on certain
          portions of the Site. But you shouldn’t just take our word on our
          approach to cookies. Most browsers are set to accept cookies by
          default, but you can usually set your browser to disable cookies, or
          to alert you when cookies are being sent. You should keep in mind that
          other websites that you go to from our Site may not share our view of
          cookies, web beacons and third-party analytics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other than web logs as described below and session cookies as
          described above, we only collect personal information through this
          Site that you choose to share with us (e.g., by signing up for our
          email list). Such personal information may include things like your
          name, address, e-mail address, affiliated organization and social
          media handles.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do use web logs, which automatically collect such information as
          information about the IP address of your computer, browser type,
          language, device information, operating system, the state or country
          from which you accessed this Site, the web pages and content visited,
          the date and the time of a visit, and the sites you visited
          immediately before this Site (e.g., a referrer page). This
          automatically collected data is generally not retained in
          non-aggregated form for more than 30 days.

        <p>
          We require that users under 18 years of age or under the age of
          majority in their jurisdiction not submit personal information. In
          accordance with the U.S. federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection
          Act of 1998 (“COPPA”), we do not knowingly collect personal
          information from children under 13 years of age.

          Do not provide information about others unless you are authorized to
          do so and consent to have all information used, disclosed and
          transferred in accordance with this Privacy Policy. By submitting
          information about others, you represent and warrant that you have
          received authorization from the person about whom you are providing
          the information and that person has consented to have all information
