              Like so many others, we’ve watched with deepening distress as the
              very technology meant to provide universal access to opportunity
              and bring us together as a society has become a primary reason for
              extreme polarization, division, and inequity.
            </b>
          </p>
          <p>
            The two of us had spent years working independently on this issue.
            We come from very different perspectives—one of us is a builder of
            social impact networks and physical infrastructure, a business and
            civic entrepreneur; the other is a builder of technology start-ups
            and social networking software. We share firsthand experience of the
            hard work, patience, vision, and long-term perspective necessary to
            build sustainable infrastructure. At an event on none other than
            Liberty Island, we made the commitment to build an important new
            piece of public infrastructure together.
          </p>
          <p>
            We focused our work with a question: Could we change technology to
            restore and then scale humanity’s capacity to build trusted
            relationships, which are the bedrock of healthy societies,
            economies, and democracies? From the beginning, we agreed that
            addressing one of the most deeply rooted problems of our time would
            require far more than new iterations of today’s entrenched and
            closed models. We needed a bold new model, built by a global
            collective of diverse, multidisciplinary thinkers and creators. We
            needed to find a way to embed values in the core technology—the
            protocol itself—as a way to protect the people who will eventually
            use it. And most importantly, we needed an open model.
          </p>
          <p>
            We identified the possibility for just such a model in what may seem
            an unexpected place: the concept at the core of the social network
            itself, known as the social graph. The term “social graph” isn’t
            widely known beyond Internet technology circles, but it is a digital
            representation of all the relationships between members of a social
            network. When we use a social network—as nearly 60 percent of the
            world does—all the ways we connect, learn, transact, consume, and
            contribute traverse this essential online circuitry. Thus, the
            social graph holds immense power over us all.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet the largest social networks are owned and controlled by
            powerful, private companies, and each is built on its own
            proprietary social graph. In this balkanized system, corporations
            broker our relationships, surveil our movements and interactions,
            and determine what information we see, amplifying the division and
            polarization plaguing us today. It has become increasingly clear
            that these old models have failed us—and the damage being caused is
            worsening by the day. Society can no longer afford models built on
            private social graphs that prioritize corporate gain over the
            welfare of society.
          </p>
          <p>
            A key to unlocking change at scale comes from building an alternate,
            open source web protocol that is driven by transparency, economic
            inclusion, trust, and societal benefit. So, in late 2019, shortly
            after that first commitment on Liberty Island, we assembled a team
            and began to build just that. Today we unveil the first phase of our
            work to the public as Project Liberty, to be followed soon by the
            release of the open source code and a call for others to learn and
            build with us.

            Reclaiming the social graph for the common good is one of the
            greatest opportunities of our time.
          </h3>
          <hr className="About__articleLine" />
          <p>
            We now have the opportunity to reclaim the social graph for the
            benefit of those who use it—to take ownership and control of our
            digital relationships from a few corporations and make it a part of
            the Internet itself, for the common good. Ownership and control of
            data will be returned to the individuals to whom it belongs.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Imagine this:</b> A unified, universally accessible social graph
            will not be owned by any organization—it will be for all of us. It
            will be open and transparent, not closed and opaque like today’s
            social graphs. It will put us in control of our own data—of what we
            choose to keep private, and what we choose to share. It will
            generate economic value for people rather than extract economic
            value from users. It will unlock opportunity for us all to directly
            benefit from the value our own network generates. It will ensure
            that we are interacting with other real people, and it will
            establish barriers against bots, false profiles, and bad actors. As
            common infrastructure, this new social graph will lower barriers for
            all kinds of entrepreneurs and social innovators, opening the market
            for new applications, business models, and algorithms—but built with
            higher standards for serving society along with shareholders. This
            new social graph will give us the capability to drive social impact
            at scale—a shared, decentralized public infrastructure that will
            support economic and social health.
          </p>
          <h2>What’s Different about Our Approach</h2>
          <p>
            Our team is not the first to explore the concept of a decentralized
            social network, but we believe our approach is distinct in its
            combination of these four elements:
          </p>
          <ol className="About__articleList">
            <li>
              <p>
                <b>The protocol is built to be a public good.</b> To become a
                universally accessible public good, the social graph must be
                freed from commercial or speculative gain at the protocol level.
                Thus, while our approach leverages public blockchains, it does
                not introduce a new token required to interact with the social
                graph. While there could be token-based models at the
                application layer, we believe a protocol layer token could
                create friction and reduce equality of access over time.

                <b>
                  We are not relying on traditional venture capital business
                  models.
                </b>{" "}
                Traditional venture capital–driven technology models have an
                important place in our economy, but the focus on short-term
                interest is at odds with the development and broad adoption of a
                decentralized, unified, and universally accessible social graph.
                Instead, we founded Project Liberty with the condition that this
                core technology will remain a common good—without expectation or
                need for a financial return.{" "}
                <b>The protocol will be gifted to humanity.</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                Of course, for the protocol to be successful, entrepreneurs must
                want to invest in innovating and participating in a new
                ecosystem. Think of the protocol as a road constructed in an
                undeveloped area. There are no returns from the road itself, but
                it could catalyze access to a thriving economy built on top of,
                and alongside, that initial investment in infrastructure. We are
                working on building the road, but we also hope to later discover
                some of these business models that can fuel sustainable
                businesses. Because the protocol will be open source,
                however—the road will be freely open to all—our team will not
                have any advantage over other developers.

                  We are placing people at the center of the protocol’s design.
                </b>{" "}
                The design of the protocol will be centered around people and
                how they want and need to interact with other people in order to
                build and leverage trusted relationships. This means we are
                embedding guardrails into the protocol to protect users and
                their data, as well as require authentication of users and
                content. We’ve seen a great deal of work that relies on the
                application layer to provide user protections, but too often
                these efforts are compromised as a result of trade-offs made to
                align with shareholder interests.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are designing the protocol with the commitment to provide all
                people with complete control of the use of their data, their
                network of relationships, and their identity, including how they
                are represented on the blockchain. We believe this is a unique
                approach to decentralizing the social graph—made possible by our
                decision that the protocol itself will not be monetized or held
                accountable to deliver financial returns.

                By nature, a social graph is connective tissue: It ties together
                many of the technology features we use today—from direct
                messaging to forums to mapping to video serving. A unified,
                decentralized social graph is thus in a critical position to
                connect the great work of many teams that are already working on
                innovative point solutions, and we are seeking to work with
                leaders across the landscape. It is for this reason that, while
                we are taking on an ambitious mission, we are focusing our scope
                in a way that will unlock open, widespread innovation and
                participation by many others.

            This project is about much more than building a new web protocol. It
            is about contributing to a broader movement of builders and creators
            who are coming together to take bold action at a pivotal moment.

            The global pandemic has challenged all of us—citizens, institutions,
            governments, and countries—in ways we never imagined. It has, like
            no other phenomenon in our remembered history, laid bare the vast
            structural vulnerabilities and inequities of our societies. Further,
            malicious actors are manipulating today’s platforms to accelerate
            the erosion of trust and weaken our institutions. We face a
            reckoning: Will we continue to look the other way—and accept the
            status quo? Or will we join together with hard work to change
            technology and create generative and sustainable structures and
            systems that unlock real opportunity not just for a few, but for
            all? We believe building this new technology to support trusted
            networks of relationships, at scale, is a critical step.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>We cannot do this important work alone.</b> It will realize its
            potential only with the collaborative effort of many communities,
            developers, thought leaders, and changemakers who are willing to
            reclaim a new order for our digital lives. Before us, at this
            moment, is an opportunity to turn away from closed models that have
            amplified fear, division, and inequity, and to choose an open model
            that offers a beacon of liberty and real hope for a better future.
            We invite you to join us in building what could be one of the most
            important public infrastructure improvements of our time.
