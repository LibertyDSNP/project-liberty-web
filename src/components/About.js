            Like so many others, we’ve watched with deepening distress as the
            very technology meant to provide universal access to opportunity and
            bring us together as a society has become a primary reason for
            extreme polarization, division, and inequity.
          </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The two of us had spent years working independently on this issue. We
          come from very different perspectives—one of us is a builder of social
          impact networks and physical infrastructure, a business and civic
          entrepreneur; the other is a builder of technology start-ups and
          social networking software. We share firsthand experience of the hard
          work, patience, vision, and long-term perspective necessary to build
          sustainable infrastructure. At an event on none other than Liberty
          Island, we made the commitment to build an important new piece of
          public infrastructure together.
        </p>
        <p>
          We focused our work with a question: Could we change technology to
          restore and then scale humanity’s capacity to build trusted
          relationships, which are the bedrock of healthy societies, economies,
          and democracies? From the beginning, we agreed that addressing one of
          the most deeply rooted problems of our time would require far more
          than new iterations of today’s entrenched and closed models. We needed
          a bold new model, built by a global collective of diverse,
          multidisciplinary thinkers and creators. We needed to find a way to
          embed values in the core technology—the protocol itself—as a way to
          protect the people who will eventually use it. And most importantly,
          we needed an open model.
        </p>
        <p>
          We identified the possibility for just such a model in what may seem
          an unexpected place: the concept at the core of the social network
          itself, known as the social graph. The term “social graph” isn’t
          widely known beyond Internet technology circles, but it is a digital
          representation of all the relationships between members of a social
          network. When we use a social network—as nearly 60 percent of the
          world does—all the ways we connect, learn, transact, consume, and
          contribute traverse this essential online circuitry. Thus, the social
          graph holds immense power over us all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet the largest social networks are owned and controlled by powerful,
          private companies, and each is built on its own proprietary social
          graph. In this balkanized system, corporations broker our
          relationships, surveil our movements and interactions, and determine
          what information we see, amplifying the division and polarization
          plaguing us today. It has become increasingly clear that these old
          models have failed us—and the damage being caused is worsening by the
          day. Society can no longer afford models built on private social
          graphs that prioritize corporate gain over the welfare of society.
        </p>
        <p>
          A key to unlocking change at scale comes from building an alternate,
          open source web protocol that is driven by transparency, economic
          inclusion, trust, and societal benefit. So, in late 2019, shortly
          after that first commitment on Liberty Island, we assembled a team and
          began to build just that. Today we unveil the first phase of our work
          to the public as Project Liberty, to be followed soon by the release
          of the open source code and a call for others to learn and build with
          us.
        </p>
        <hr class="About__articleLine" />
        <aside class="About__articleInterjection">
          Reclaiming the social graph for the common good is one of the greatest
          opportunities of our time.
        </aside>
        <hr class="About__articleLine" />
        <p>
          We now have the opportunity to reclaim the social graph for the
          benefit of those who use it—to take ownership and control of our
          digital relationships from a few corporations and make it a part of
          the Internet itself, for the common good. Ownership and control of
          data will be returned to the individuals to whom it belongs.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Imagine this:</b> A unified, universally accessible social graph
          will not be owned by any organization—it will be for all of us. It
          will be open and transparent, not closed and opaque like today’s
          social graphs. It will put us in control of our own data—of what we
          choose to keep private, and what we choose to share. It will generate
          economic value for people rather than extract economic value from
          users. It will unlock opportunity for us all to directly benefit from
          the value our own network generates. It will ensure that we are
          interacting with other real people, and it will establish barriers
          against bots, false profiles, and bad actors. As common
          infrastructure, this new social graph will lower barriers for all
          kinds of entrepreneurs and social innovators, opening the market for
          new applications, business models, and algorithms—but built with
          higher standards for serving society along with shareholders. This new
          social graph will give us the capability to drive social impact at
          scale—a shared, decentralized public infrastructure that will support
          economic and social health.
        </p>
        <h2>What’s Different about Our Approach</h2>
        <p>
          Our team is not the first to explore the concept of a decentralized
          social network, but we believe our approach is distinct in its
          combination of these four elements:
        </p>
        <ol class="About__articleList">
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>The protocol is built to be a public good.</b> To become a
              universally accessible public good, the social graph must be freed
              from commercial or speculative gain at the protocol level. Thus,
              while our approach leverages public blockchains, it does not
              introduce a new token required to interact with the social graph.
              While there could be token-based models at the application layer,
              we believe a protocol layer token could create friction and reduce
              equality of access over time.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>
                We are not relying on traditional venture capital business
                models.
              </b>{" "}
              Traditional venture capital–driven technology models have an
              important place in our economy, but the focus on short-term
              interest is at odds with the development and broad adoption of a
              decentralized, unified, and universally accessible social graph.
              Instead, we founded Project Liberty with the condition that this
              core technology will remain a common good—without expectation or
              need for a financial return.{" "}
              <b>The protocol will be gifted to humanity.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course, for the protocol to be successful, entrepreneurs must
              want to invest in innovating and participating in a new ecosystem.
              Think of the protocol as a road constructed in an undeveloped
              area. There are no returns from the road itself, but it could
              catalyze access to a thriving economy built on top of, and
              alongside, that initial investment in infrastructure. We are
              working on building the road, but we also hope to later discover
              some of these business models that can fuel sustainable
              businesses. Because the protocol will be open source, however—the
              road will be freely open to all—our team will not have any
              advantage over other developers.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>
                We are placing people at the center of the protocol’s design.
              </b>{" "}
              The design of the protocol will be centered around people and how
              they want and need to interact with other people in order to build
              and leverage trusted relationships. This means we are embedding
              guardrails into the protocol to protect users and their data, as
              well as require authentication of users and content. We’ve seen a
              great deal of work that relies on the application layer to provide
              user protections, but too often these efforts are compromised as a
              result of trade-offs made to align with shareholder interests.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are designing the protocol with the commitment to provide all
              people with complete control of the use of their data, their
              network of relationships, and their identity, including how they
              are represented on the blockchain. We believe this is a unique
              approach to decentralizing the social graph—made possible by our
              decision that the protocol itself will not be monetized or held
              accountable to deliver financial returns.
            </p>

              <b>
                Although our vision is bold, we are focused on achievable
                innovation.
              </b>{" "}
              By nature, a social graph is connective tissue: It ties together
              many of the technology features we use today—from direct messaging
              to forums to mapping to video serving. A unified, decentralized
              social graph is thus in a critical position to connect the great
              work of many teams that are already working on innovative point
              solutions, and we are seeking to work with leaders across the
              landscape. It is for this reason that, while we are taking on an
              ambitious mission, we are focusing our scope in a way that will
              unlock open, widespread innovation and participation by many
              others.

        <p>
          This project is about much more than building a new web protocol. It
          is about contributing to a broader movement of builders and creators
          who are coming together to take bold action at a pivotal moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The global pandemic has challenged all of us—citizens, institutions,
          governments, and countries—in ways we never imagined. It has, like no
          other phenomenon in our remembered history, laid bare the vast
          structural vulnerabilities and inequities of our societies. Further,
          malicious actors are manipulating today’s platforms to accelerate the
          erosion of trust and weaken our institutions. We face a reckoning:
          Will we continue to look the other way—and accept the status quo? Or
          will we join together with hard work to change technology and create
          generative and sustainable structures and systems that unlock real
          opportunity not just for a few, but for all? We believe building this
          new technology to support trusted networks of relationships, at scale,
          is a critical step.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>We cannot do this important work alone.</b> It will realize its
          potential only with the collaborative effort of many communities,
          developers, thought leaders, and changemakers who are willing to
          reclaim a new order for our digital lives. Before us, at this moment,
          is an opportunity to turn away from closed models that have amplified
          fear, division, and inequity, and to choose an open model that offers
          a beacon of liberty and real hope for a better future. We invite you
          to join us in building what could be one of the most important public
          infrastructure improvements of our time.
